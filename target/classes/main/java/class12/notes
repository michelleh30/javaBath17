Methods/Functions/Behaviours/Routines
    methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
    when we call a methods;example scanner

we are creating the obj of scanner class
     Scanner scanner=new Scanner(System.in);
     using the scanner obj we are calling the nextInt methods
     scanner.nextInt();//this is calling the methods

Methods/Functions/Behaviours/Routines
      Methods are are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
      When we call a methods

----There are two types of methods:
       1)Methods which do not return any data ( void type)
       2)Methods which can return data like int double char etc.
Syntax:
int add ( int num1,int num2){

          int result=num1+num2;

          return result;
        }
==========
datatype methodName (datatype nameOfParameter, dataType nameOfOtherParam){
this is where we write the logic

retrun the results if method type is not void

                   }
int=> return type of method
add=> nma eof the method int num1,int num2) => parameters
                  {   =>>>> Body of the method
                  int result = num1+num2


Using static when its in the same class

must write an import statement if there if classes are from 2 different packages
ex. package review1-class Calculator
    package class12-class E2CalculatoeTester
            in this class you have to write the import statement
                import.review1.Calculator;
                import.nameof the package.name of the class;

know what is palindrome string

void method you can not store data
