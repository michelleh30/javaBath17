Constructors:
    Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a more secure and neat way.
    We can also put any piece of code that we want to execute when the object of a class is created.
    it helps us build objects from class easily, whatever code you put in a constructor
    that will be executed first from the instance method. Must have the same name as class

Why we should use Constructors?
    1.They help us write more secure classes
    2.Cleaner code
    3.More control over the values we can assign to the instance fields

Syntax:
    1.No return type not even void
    2.Same name as class
    3.Usually public access modifier---we use public
    4.Parameters---
    5.Body of the constructor

Rules:




When you put this.(name) with local variable its going to look at parameter
better to use "this" in our constructors

Having more con is good to have more option
this.() to save space of code

instance feild belong to the obj, one variable many value
static is assign to one value and belong to class
