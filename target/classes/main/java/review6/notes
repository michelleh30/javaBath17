What is Object oriented programming(OOP)
    Its simply a way of writing code. some rules that we follow. there are other ways
    as well like functional programming,procedural programming. We treat everything as an obj. We first create a class and then obj
    ex. cells phone, creat a class and methods--funtions in a block of code,
     There are four main
    pillars of OOP
    1)inheritance---it will help u to reuse the code of a different class
    2) Polymorphism---many forms, code will be dynamic
    3) Abstraction---something that is not clear to do, use this to write code that you know leave the other details for someone else that knows
    4) Encapsulation---when ever we want to protect sensitive info private keyword and constuctive

Why should we learn OOP:
    1) Code re-usability.--easy to reuse
    2) Its easier to write large amounts of code.
    3) sharing code with others become easier.
    4) Security of the code is increased.
    5) Changing code becomes easier.

Object:
    An Object is something that we can physically touch. Everything around us like
    chairs, tables, computer etc. They are all objects. We can easily represent
    these objects inside our computers by telling a computer how an object
    looks like and how it behaves.

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.

String class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data. Most of the
    information inside computers is processed in this form. String is most widely
    used class in all java.

Creating objects from String class.
      1)length()--count how many letter they are
      2) isEmpty()--boolean check if string has any letter or is empty

Instance variable---it's inside the class but outside the block of code;
if a variable is declare create outside of any block of code but inside a class

Using String. split() Method.
Using Pattern. split() Method.
Using String[ ] Approach.
Using toArray() Method.
