Set:
    are special set of classes which do not allow duplicate elements.
    Set is the main interface and there are 3 main classes which implement
    the interface.

        1.HashSet
        2.LinkedSet
        3.TreeSet
        thet all are doing the set interface

HashSet:
    Upside: its the fasted out of all of them
    downside: it doesn't remember the insertion order. The way we put code inside, doesn't maintain the position of it.
