2 ways to create a String

instance var.: they are located outside the block of code/inside the class, they belong to the obj and not class

static var: we do not need an obj to access them, they belong to the class but outside of any method, we know they
are static b/c its says static

constructor: calling the con when creating the obj, is a block of code similar to a method executed when creating an obj
Constructors help us create the objects from the classes
const to instalizw the obj
