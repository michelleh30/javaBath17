Abstraction:
    is the process of hiding details and showing only the functionality to
    the end user.
    allows use to fouce
    its flixable,hiding the deatils
    remove the heard part to make it abtract
    So every child class of an abstract parent class must have all the methods from the parent class
    Why should we use Ab
    1. Flexibility(if we dont know or dont want to provid use Abstract
    What the point of ab?
    leaving implementation of different objects behaviors to the end user of the parent class
     basically abstract is for incomplete classes\
     polymorphism? same method giving different output; polymorphism is many forms of methods
