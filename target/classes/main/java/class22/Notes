inher is to help us use the code
 void move(){
        you can write code inside
    }this mean body in a method

Interface:
    Are like contracts/abtract. In which we define abstract methods which the classes have to implement.
    They can also have public static var.

Why should we learn about interface?
      1.Specially designed for abstraction
      2. light weight as compared to abstract classes
      3. we can achieve multi inheritance in interface
      4. there is no diamond problem when having multi inheritance
      5. help us build things in a modular way can be used with classes
      even if they are not closely related.

by defuly all the feil inside are public static final
multiple classes thue dont need to have a connection,multiple inhe
abstract needs implementation

Rules:
    1. Interfaces dont have instance methods but can have static method
    2. No instance feild are allowed, all the feild inside an interface are public
    static final
    3.No constructors are allowed
    4. Cant create objects as there are no constructors
    5. Cant have final keyword with interface or methods as they are default abstract
    6.
