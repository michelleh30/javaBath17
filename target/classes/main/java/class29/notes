Types of Errors in Java:
    There are three main types in java.

1.Syntax errors/ Compile time errors--when it underlines red error
    easiest error to fuiner out
    ex.
        int age=10;
        age int=10;
        error
IDE: (integrated development environment)
    Intellij is an IDE
    IDEs typically provide a code editor, a compiler or interpreter and a debugger
    that the developer accesses through a unified graphical user interface

How to slove Syntax/Compile time error?
    1. most of the time your IDE(integrated development environment) is going to help you
    2. Comiler will also generte anb error with line numbers and explanations
    3. You can look for the rules of the language
=============================================================================================================
2. Logical errors/Bugs
    it happen because we didn't write the logical correctly
    Logical occur when programs do not generate the expected outputs.

How to fix this types of errors/bugs:
    we can use Dubugger to fix these types of errors
    testing first
    report to developer
============================================================================
3.Runtime errors/Exceptions
   *are unwanted events that disrupts that normal flow of a program
   we only get this error after we run the code
   its the worst error

How to fix runtime/Exceptions errors?


if an error can be voided with an If condition use that instand of try-catch block

uncheck exceptions(same problem)
    use if condition
    most of the time its because of programmer mistake or

check exceptions
    they can never be voided using if condtion meaning use try-catch block or adding the exceptions in the main method
    better to user the try catch block
================================================================================
In the try catch block
Try:
    write the code that is going to give a problem
    give it a chance

Catch:
    its the code that its going to excuced if the try code happens
    can have many catch blocks code
    the last block can be just and exceptions because its the parent class

IOException is the parent of file not found exception

Finally is a block to close critcle resouse ex closing file but we dont use this version any more
