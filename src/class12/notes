Methods/Functions/Behaviours/Routines
    methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
    when we call a methods;example scanner

    we are creating the obj of scanner class
            Scanner scanner=new Scanner(System.in);
            using the scanner obj we are calling the nextInt methods
            scanner.nextInt();//this is calling the methods

        Methods/Functions/Behaviours/Routines
            Methods are are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
            When we call a methods

         ----There are two types of methods:
               1)Methods which do not return any data ( void type)
               2)Methods which can return data like int double char etc.


                   ==========
                   datatype methodName (datatype nameOfParameter, dataType nameOfOtherParam){
                   this is where we write the logic
                   retrun the results if method type is not void

                   }

                Syntax:
                int add ( int num1,int num2){
                           int result=num1+num2;
                           return result;
                           }
                  int=> return type of method
                  add=> nma eof the method
                  (int num1,int num2) => parameters
                  {   =>>>> Body of the method
                  int result = num1+num2
