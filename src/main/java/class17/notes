Inheritance:
    allows one class to have all the properties and
                 methods from another class except private members and constructors.
                 We use extends keyword. Allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another class.
                 Except private method / constructors
                 we use extends keywords.

Why should we learn about Inheritance:
                1) Faster development
                2) Saves memory
                less code


problem in inheritance couple:
            dont more use it, 3-4 classes is fine,
            if use too much its a dominion effect if you change something in one it will affect
            everything in the other classes

Syntax:
    class Parent{

    }

    class Child extends Parent{

    }

Rules:
    1) Private members(fields and methods) are not accessible in child classes.
    2) Constructors are also no available for child classes directly.

Types of Inheritance:
    1) Single
    2) Hierarchical
    3) MultiLevel
    4) Hybrid
    5) Multiple(It is not supported by java)

1)Single Inheritance:
    Only one parent and only one child(Not very common).
2)Hierarchical:
    One parent multiple child.
3)MultiLevel:
    Multilevel inheritance happens when a class C inherits from B and B inherits from A.
4) Hybrid:
    Hybrid is a mixture of Hierarchical and MultiLevel.
5)Multiple:
        Multiple parent classes and one child class.
        child well get confuse to know which parent it will want to go



What is Diamond problem in OOP?:
            The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A,
            and a further class D inherits from both B and C, so that if there is a method in A that B
            it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.

                    So, the "diamond problem" is like when you have this tricky situation where you inherit something from
                    two different sides of your family (in our example, from both mom and dad), and they both want to change
                    or add something to it. It can be confusing because you have to decide which change to pick or how to
                    combine them.
