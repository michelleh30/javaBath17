Maps:
    Are dataStructures (there are 3) which store key value pairs. There are many diff types in Java
        1.HashMap--no order but fast
        2.LinkedHashMap--slower but remember the order you put
        3.TreeMap--ascending order/slowest
        4.HashTable
        Maps are not part of the collections framework. Map is the name of the interface and HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap,
        HashTable are the classes that implement this interface

Why we should learn about Maps?
    All the other dataStructures that we learned can only store one value at a  time and they are indexed based.
    Maps allow us to store key vaule pairs which makes the a better choice b/c we know what we are storing.

Syntax of Maps:

    NameOfTheClass<DataTypeOfKey,DataTypeOfValue> variableName=new NameOfTheClass<>();

    ArrayList<String,Double> names=new ArrayList<>();
