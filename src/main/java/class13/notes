Types of the variables: 3 types

local - temporary
instance- Long
static- permanent.
***********************************

Local variables:
            are the variables which are created, declared inside a block of code. like if else condition,
            loop, switch statement, methods are block of code. They can only be work from inside the code


upside:
            they occupy the memory for shorttest pd of time.As soon as java is done executing that
            block of code they are remove from memory. Java does not allow it to be accessed outside the block.
            It saves space, it makes spaces for other variables


downside:
            they can only be accessed within the block of code they are created.

*****************************************

Instance var:
            are the var. which are created outside of the blocks(if else,switch,loops or methods etc.)
            of codes but inside a class.

 Upside:
            They can be accessed anywhere within the class

 Downside:
            They are created when an object of the class is created and they will
            stay in the memory as long as that object is in the  memory whether you
            use them or not

************************************************
Static var:
            are created inside a class but outside of a block of code. Cant be local.
            And are instance var but with STATIC keyword.

Upside:
            They are universal when it comes to scope and accessibility.We dont even need to create the obj
            of that class in which they are created


Downside:
            Static var occupy the memory for longest of all.


Use of types of local var:
            Local:
                Whenever we are solving any problems many times we need local var to temporally store data.
                 In all of these cases you should be going with local var



Note:
    we will do a little bit of StringBuilder
    we will discuss Thread safety StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
    one ex for meoths as well
    Project 1

static differs from instant by adding staic before data type right?
