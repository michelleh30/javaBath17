Why use the super keyword?
    1.To specifically call something from parent class variable method or contertor. Like
        not private
    2. We can use super()

MethodOverLoading:
    1. When we have same method with different parameter its called method overload. Parameter can
    be different in 3 ways
        num of parameters, data type, sequence
    2. We  can change the count of parameters. We can overload method as well as constructors.
    3. We can also change the datatype of parameters if the numbers of parameters are
    same.
    4. We can change the sequence if datatype and number of parameters are the same.
Why?
    1. Clearer code: we dont have to come up with different method names.
    2. Reuse: same name can be reused many times.
