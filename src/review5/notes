Arrays: data stucher/ elements of the same types
stores in the index
Stores alot of data and same data
stores multi variable
can use loops- it repeats a block of codes
    when we dont name the exact number of iterations/repetition-use while or do while
    when we know how many times we want to repeat or iterate the code- for loop
        to diff types of for loops normal and Enhance for loop, use index
    Enhance for loop: Only with arrays or collections
    Enhance for loop/for each loop/advanced for syntax
            for(DataTypeofElement anyVariableName:NameofTheDataStructure){
                            }
element being store to index
index start with a 0

2 DArrays
